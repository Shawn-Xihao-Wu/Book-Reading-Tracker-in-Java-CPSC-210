# Book Reading Tracker
## CPSC 210 Term Project
### *By Shawn Xihao Wu*


This application is intended to provide anyone who loves to read a good way 
to keep track of their readings.

As a university student, I often find myself lost in 
the mountains of readings assigned by each course. I want to build a simple program 
that could help me stay on top of my readings, and I hope that it could 
help others who feel the same.


### User Stories:

- As a user, I want to be able to add books to my bookshelf
- As a user, I want to classify books by genre when adding books to the bookshelf


- As a user, I want to be able to see how many distinct genres are there on the bookshelf and what are they
- As a user, I want to be able to view the list of books on my bookshelf and their genres
- As a user, I want to be able to see how many books are in one certain book genre (1 book can have multiple genres)


- As a user, I want to be able to select a book and update how many pages I have read for this book


- As a user, I want to be able to see all my reading progress for each book in terms of percentage rounded to the nearest tenth decimal
- As a user, I want to be able to see my total reading progress in terms of percentage rounded to the nearest tenth decimal

- As a user, I want to be able to save current collection of books to file
- As a user, I want to be able to load previous collection of books from file and resume exactly where I left off last time
