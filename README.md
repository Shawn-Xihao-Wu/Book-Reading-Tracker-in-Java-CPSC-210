# Book Reading Tracker
### CPSC 210 Term Project Phase 1
#### *By Shawn Xihao Wu*


This application is intended to provide anyone who loves to read a good way 
to keep track of their readings.

As a student in the Faculty of Arts, I often find myself lost in 
the mountains of readings assigned by each course. I want to build a simple program 
that could help me stay on top of my readings, and I hope that it could 
help others who feel the same.
